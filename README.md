# Mass Effect 3 Ace Slammer Host
Become a dunk master in Mass Effect 3 by having gravity go up and down to slam dunk your friends and foes. Gravity will go up sharply, then go into zero G, and then slam downwards for several seconds. All pawns in ragdoll will be continously dunked mercilessly.

## Usage

Pass the Mass Effect 3 game directory as a parameter to this EXE. In the game you'll need full console access (for MP), and have set the O keybind to Exec slamming.txt.
`setbind O "Exec slamming.txt"'

Once the slamming begins it will type the letter O for you which triggers the script it is automatically updating. Mass Effect 3 will be brought to the foreground automatically, which means you will need to exit the game for this effect to stop. Close the slammer application to resume normal system behavior.
